#   Setup

# The Numeric context is used while defining the formula, as it only
# requires numeric values.
Context("Numeric");

#-ULETH-#
$a = random(1,10,1)*random(-1,1,2);
$b = random(1,10,1)*random(-1,1,2);

# $s is the formula used in the question.
$s = Compute("$a*cos(x) + $b*sin(x)")->reduce();

# Answers can only be entered as intervals.
Context("Interval");

# This ensures that the student's answer is kept in the form it is entered.
# E.g. If a fraction is entered, it will not be reduced to a decimal.
Context()->flags->set(formatStudentAnswer=>'parsed');

# The following flag can be uncommented to allow open and closed intervals.
# E.g. 1 < x < 2, 1 <= x < 2, 1 < x <= 2, and 1 <= x <= 2 would all be marked correct.
# Context()->flags->set(ignoreEndpointTypes=>1);

$domain = Compute("(-inf,inf)");

Give the interval(s) on which the function is continuous.

#  Solution

#-ULETH-#
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Both [`\sin(x)`] and [`\cos(x)`] are continuous everywhere. Since [`s(x)`] is the sum of two functions which are continuous everywhere, [`s(x)`] is also continuous everywhere.
