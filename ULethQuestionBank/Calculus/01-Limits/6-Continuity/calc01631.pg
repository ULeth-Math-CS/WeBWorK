#   Setup

# The Numeric context is used while defining the formula, as it only
# requires numeric values.
Context("Numeric");

#-ULETH-#
$a = random(1,10,1);

# $f is the formula used in the question.
$f = Compute("sqrt($a-e^{x})")->reduce();

# Answers can only be entered as intervals.
Context("Interval")->variables->are(x=>"Real");

# This ensures that the student's answer is kept in the form it is entered.
# E.g. If a fraction is entered, it will not be reduced to a decimal.
Context()->flags->set(formatStudentAnswer=>'parsed');

# The following flag can be uncommented to allow open and closed intervals.
# E.g. 1 < x < 2, 1 <= x < 2, 1 < x <= 2, and 1 <= x <= 2 would all be marked correct.
# Context()->flags->set(ignoreEndpointTypes=>1);

$domain = Compute("(-inf,ln($a)]");

#  Solution

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

We require the terms inside the radical to be positive. Therefore, we must have [`e^x \leq [$a]`]. This occurs exactly when [`x \leq \ln{[$a]}`]. Hence, [`f(x)`] is continuous on [`(-\infty,\ln{[$a]}]`].
