#  Setup
# Here is where the setup for the problem is done.
# In general, this will include setting up any variables that are being
# used in the question, including those that are equal to constants and formulas

# Here we prepare the correct answer set.
# We have two lists
# One strings in the answer given in the correct order
# followed by a list of strings that are not in the correct answer.

"So \(xy = (\frac{a}{b}) (\frac{a}{b}) = \frac{ac}{bd}\) ",
"And since the integers are closed under multiplication, we know \(ac\) \(bd\) are integers, we also know that \(bd \ne 0\) because \(b \ne 0 \ne d\)",

BEGIN_PGML
Use the appropriate tiles below to reconstruct the direct proof of the following conjecture.

The product of two rational numbers is rational.

(Note: There is one correct order for the tiles in the proof and some of the tiles do not appear in correct the proof.).
