BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Slution a: Count [$range1][$range2] as a single letter. Then we will have total 6 letters. So total number of permutations are = [`P(6,6)`]=[$answerA] 

Solution b:  The only way that these three strings could exist simultaneously is if the letters DEABG are adjacent, which leaves only C and F on their own so there are [`P(3,3) = [$answerB]`] ways to do this.
