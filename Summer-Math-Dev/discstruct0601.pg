BEGIN_PGML
Citadel Security Executor, Venari Pallin, must choose [$numInTaskForce] officers
to serve on a task force from a group of [$ttlOfficers] eligible officers.  The
[$ttlOfficers] are comprised of [$numTurian] Turian officers,
[$numAsari] Asari officers, [$numSalarian] Salarian officers, and
[$numHuman] Human officers.

a. How many ways can a task force including exactly 2 Turians be formed? [_______][@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

b. How many ways can a task force including no Turians be formed? [_______][@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

c. How many ways can a task force including at least one officer of each species
be formed? [_______][@ AnswerFormatHelp("numbers") @]*

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a.  Choose 2 of the [$numTurian] Turians and [$numInTaskForce - 2]
of the [$ttlOfficers - $numTurian] non-Turians.

    [`\left(
        \begin{array}{c}
          [$numTurian]\\
          2
        \end{array}
      \right)
      *
      \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
          [$ttlOfficers - $numTurian]\\
          [$numInTaskForce - 2]
        \end{array}
      \right)
    `]

b.  Choose all [$numInTaskForce] officers from the [$ttlOfficers - $numTurian] non-Turians.

    [`\left(
        \begin{array}{c}
          [$ttlOfficers - $numTurian]\\
          [$numInTaskForce]
        \end{array}
      \right)
    `]

c.  Choose 1 officer from each species, and [$numInTaskForce - 4] from the
remaining [$ttlOfficers - 4] officers.

    [`\left(
        \begin{array}{c}
          [$numTurian]\\
