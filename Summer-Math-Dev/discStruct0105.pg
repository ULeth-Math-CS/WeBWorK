BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
A statement that can be determined as True or False is known as Proposition.

1) Proposition. The statement is true.

2) Proposition. The statement is false.

3) Not a proposition. Since, the valuw of [`x`] is unknown we can't determine whether the statement is true or false.

4) Not a proposition. It's a question.

5) Not a proposition. Since the value of n is unknown.

6) Not a proposition.

7) Proposition. This is an order.

8) Not a proposition. It's a question.

9) Proposition. The statement can be true or false.

10) Proposition. The statement can be true or false.
