#  Setup
# Here is where the setup for the problem is done.
# In general, this will include setting up any variables that are being
# used in the question, including those that are equal to constants and formulas


#-ULETH-#

# Here we prepare the correct answer set.
# We have two lists
# One strings in the answer given in the correct order
# followed by a list of strings that are not in the correct answer.
$CorrectProof = DraggableProof([
"1",
"\(\sqrt{2}\)",
"\(\pi\)",
"4",
"\(4^2\)"
],

[
"This is not a number",
"Apple pie"
],
#Put all the entries under the left column and specify these as SourceLabel
#TargetLabel is the column after ordering all the entries 
SourceLabel => "Choose from these:",
TargetLabel =>  "Place the numbers in increasing order here:",

#  Main text

BEGIN_TEXT
Enter question text here, for example:
Place the numbers in increasing order by dragging them from the left column to the right column. Don't use tiles that don't contain numbers.
$BR$BR
NOTE: You must drag the tile to the top of the right column then move it down into place.
$PAR

# Setting this to 1 means that students will receive feedback on whether their
# answers are correct.
