BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Slution a:
Here total player is [$numberPeople]. 

So the first position can turn out in [`[$numberPeople]`] ways

Similarly second position can turn out in [`[$numberPeople -1]`] ways and so on.

According to the product rules, total number of ways is = [`[$numberPeople] * [$numberPeople -1]*.......*1 = P([$numberPeople],[$m]) = [$answerA] `] 

Slution b:
Position [`[$place]`] can be filled up by Iron Man in only [`1`] ways. Rest of the positions will be filled up in [$numberPeople -1] [`!`] ways. So total number of outcome is = [`[$answerB]`].
