BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION


Recall that the division algorithm tells us that for any integer [`n`] and any positive integer

d there exists unique values q and r such that [`d = dq + r`] with [`0 \le r < d`].

Solution a:

For [`n`] = [`145`] and [`d`] = [`17`] we notice that

Since [`8 * 17 = 136`] and [`9 * 17 = 153`],

hence [`q = 8 `] and [`r = 145 -136 = 9`].

Therefore, [`145 = (8) 17 + 9`].

Solution b:

For [`n`] = [`-102`] and [`d`] = [`9`] we notice that

Since [`-11 * 9 = -99`] and [`-12 * 9 = -108`],

hence [`q = -12 `] and [`r = ( -108) - ( -102) = 6`].

Therefore, [`-102 = (-12) 9 + 6`].
