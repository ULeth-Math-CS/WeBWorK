# Here we prepare the correct answer set.
# We have two lists
# One strings in the answer given in the correct order
# followed by a list of strings that are not in the correct answer.

BEGIN_PGML
Use the appropriate tiles below to reconstruct the proof by cases of the following conjecture.

Prove that if n is an integer then [`n^2 - n + 1`] is positive.

(Note: There is one correct order for the tiles in the proof and some of the tiles do not appear in correct the proof.).

#  Solution

#-ULETH-#
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We have to consider all possible cases.Here in this problem there are 3 cases for n- zero, positive and negative. If [`n^2 - n +1`] holds positive for all three possible values of [`n`] then we can say the statement is true otherwise false.
