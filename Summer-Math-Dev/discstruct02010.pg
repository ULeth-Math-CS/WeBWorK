# How to add a new question:
# Step 1. Add a new Matrix object if necessary for the question.
# Step 2. Compute the answer(s) for the new question.
# Step 3. Add the text for the new question to the main text of the problem.
#   Also add an answer blank for the student to fill in their answer.
#   If necessary, also add the AnswerFormatHelp after the blank so that
#   students can get some help with inputting their answer.
#   If you have LaTeX code you want to display, enter it in the [``] brackets.
#   If you want previously-defined values to display in LaTeX, include the
#   MathObject name in your LaTeX brackets, enclosed in square brackets.
#   Use $answer3->ans_array(5) statement to take the matrix stored in $answer3 and
#   place text boxes for answer entry on the page based on the matrix layout.
#   Each box in this case has space for 5 characters.
#   On the other hand, use ans_box(r,c) for a single text box with r rows and c columns.
# Step 4. Add an answer checker for the new question.  Use ANS($answer->cmp());
#   to call the checker, and make sure that the answers are in the same order
#   as their associated blanks in the problem.
# Step 5. Add solution text for the question, assuming that you have some special
#   solution text you want students to be able to see after the assignment due date.
#   If you have LaTeX code you want to display, enter it in the [``] brackets.
#   If you want previously-defined values to display in LaTeX, include the
#   MathObject name in your LaTeX brackets, enclosed in square brackets.
#   If you want to access individual Matrix elements, use [@ $matrix->element(row,col) @]*

# $A, $B and $C are the three 3x3 initial matrices for the question.

# If $B = Matrix([a, b, c]), then $B->transpose = Matrix([[a], [b], [c]]).
# If $B = 3 columns, each with 1 element,
# then $B->transpose = 3 rows, each with 1 element.
# We define two separate answers so that one can be converted to an array of
# answer blanks.

# Step 2. Compute the answer(s) for the new question.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Solution a: Let [`A=[a_{ij}]`], [`B=[b_{ij}]`] and [`C=[c_{ij}]`] be an [`m \times n`].The [`sum`] of A, B and C, denoted by A + B + C is the [`m \times n`] matrix that has [`a_{ij} + b_{ij} + c_{ij}`] as its [`(i,j)`]th element. 
For example, [`a_{11} + b_{11} + c_{11}`] = [$answerArrayA->element(1,1)] is the [`(1,1)`]th element of the answer matrix.

Solution b: A is a [`3 \times 3`] matrix and B is a [`3 \times 3`] matrix, the product AB is defined and is a [`3 \times 3`] matrix. To find the elements of AB, the corresponding elements of the rows of A and the columns of B are first multiplied and then these products are added. For, instance 
[`a_{11} \times b_{11} + a_{12} \times b_{21} + a_{13} \times b_{31} = ([$A->element(1,1)] \times [$B->element(1,1)]) + ([$A->element(1,2)] \times [$B->element(2,1)]) \times ([$A->element(2,1)] \times [$B->element(1,3)]) = [$p] `]. Now add the [`C_{1,1}`] with it to get the the [`(1,1)`]th element of the answer matrix. So, [`[$answerArrayB->element(1,1) - $ C->element(1,1)] + [$C->element(1,1)] = [$answerArrayB->element(1,1)].`]  

Slotuion c: First get the [`B \times B`] matrix. If [`B \times B`] is C then do [`C \times B`] to get the answer.
