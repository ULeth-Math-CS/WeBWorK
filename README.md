# WeBWorK
Templates, programming examples, and problem libraries for WeBWorK at U of L.

The advice and guidelines available in the Documentation section can also be accessed (without cloning this repository) on the [Math and Computer Science department website](http://www.uleth.ca/artsci/math-computer-science/webwork).

This is the first version of all templates and programming examples, as well as the fledgling version of the question bank.

*Update for August 2018:* Summer 2018 Question Bank development now merged into master. Clone the master branch from `/opt/webwork/libraries` on your WeBWorK server to add these problems. Instructions for linking your course to the new library can be found on the [WeBWorK site](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Open_Problem_Library#.W4bTUJxMHRY).

**Developers:** please ensure that any new work is committed to the dev branch for review.
